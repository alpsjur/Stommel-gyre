:ocean: Stommel gyre model setup in Oceananigans.jl.


The Stommel gyre is a basic model of ocean circulation in a rectangular basin forced by a wind stress that varies in the north-south direction. It's a classic problem used to demonstrate the effects of the Coriolis force and western intensification in ocean currents.
